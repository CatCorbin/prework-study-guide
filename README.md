## Description

As a coding bootcamp student myself, I built this website to organize study materials to be used by myself and others. The webpage makes studying easier by having the most important components listed. The webpage is fun to use due to the cute design as well as the random generation of what you should study next.
This was my first time ever truly coding and it is amazing the things that you can acheive on a laptop at home.

## Usage

This webpage was designed to be used for students who are learning coding and web development. The page features notes on the subjects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When the console on DevTools is opened, a subject will be randomly generated for the viewer to study. Every time the page is refreshed the console will randomly assign the next topic to be studied. This aspect makes the act of studying a little bit more exciting.
